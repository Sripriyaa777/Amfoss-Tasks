# Conquering The Terminal Wizard

## Introductory
In this vast field of computing,mastering the art of Terminal command is indeed like having a powerfull tool to navigate through our problems.One of the many tasks i got to lay my hands onn set me up on a thrilling adventure which tested my understanding in basic terminal and git commands through exciting narrative theme.Let me take you through this in detail-
Our mission here is very clear,Explore the Linux Terminal, tackle obstacles, and solve riddles to dig up secret codes.The narrative takes us on journey of legendary characters and a mysterious Emperor.

## Technical Details
Each commands lead me to a new door to unlock the next path. Understanding git and terminal commands make the work a piece of cake,It's really fun to navigate around open up directories and files to get hold of secreat codes.
Following here some of the git and terminal commands i used:

*`cd <directory_path>`: Change the current working directory to a specified directory

*`ls`: List files and directories in the current directory

*`grep`:Searches for text in files.

*`chmod`:Changes file permissions.

*`tree`:Displays the directory structure of the current directory

*`nano <file_name>`: Opens the default text editor for editing or creating a file

*`cat <file_name>`: Display the contents of a text file

*`exit`: Exit terminal session

*`echo -n <Base64EncodedStringHere> | base64 -d`: Decodes the Base64 code

*`git clone <url>`: copy's all the content from the hosted URL

*`git status`: shows modified files

*`git init`: makes it as a git repository

*`git add .` : adds all the files to commit

*`git commit -m "Example Message"`: commits your content, a message can be added to display in the commit log

*`git push`: pushes all the contents in the local branch to remote branch

*`git branch`: lists all the branches present

*`git checkout <branch name>`: switches from one branch to another branch

## My Experience

This journey through the terminal and git commands did not just test my technical skill but also took me through exciting and fun challenges.Even though it was  overwhelming at times the satisfaction  i get on cracking a code or finding a new path is just amazing.
I navigated through the directories, searching for the hidden files that held the secret codes each command was a weapon.Switching between branches was my  favorite part it was fun exploring all the realms to discover the secret riddles.Decoading part of the challenge was soo rewarding,This indeed was a fun and interactive task.
