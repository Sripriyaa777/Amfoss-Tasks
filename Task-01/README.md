## My Update
It took some time to adapt to touch typing. Although I now understand the layout of the keyboard and how to position my fingers correctly. I'm still working on increasing my speed. I've managed to reach 50 WPM, and I plan to continue improving so that I can type more effortlessly.
I am focusing on proper finger placement and minimizing unnecessary movements , which will help me type more fluidly.
