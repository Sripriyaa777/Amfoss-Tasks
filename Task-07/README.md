# Overview
This was the most frustrating task ever, Stared off with Pythons Click module to create a command-line interface for adding options and handling user input which I could follow up from tutorial videos.

Then I created an OMDB API in order to fetch the IMDb ID from the movie's name.
The rest of the task was driving me crazy. I had no idea about web scraping (especially, with all the specified filters).
After several tries I could come up with a code to scrap the list of available subtitiles from Opensubtitles. I could not include the bash mode. The rest of the criteria works well.

**To Run the code-**

python3  Code.py  "https://dn720404.ca.archive.org/0/items/plan-9-from-outer-space/plan-9-from-outer-space.mpeg4"  -l  eng  -o /path/to/output  --file-size --match-by-hash
