# Overview
This task went on smoothly, as I'm already familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from 1st year.

Firstly, I began with the terminal interface and intergrated it with FakeStoreAPI to fetch product data.
then managed command handling to fetch and display products within the terminal interface.

Then I went on to create a user interface using Html and CSS that also fetches data from FakeStoreAPI and displays products in grid layout. I have successfully included all the commands given.
