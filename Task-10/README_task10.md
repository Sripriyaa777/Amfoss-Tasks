# Overview
I began by sorting the files. Then I learned some basis of image processing using OpenCV to detect the colored dot in each image and convert it to grayscale, applying a threshold, and then finding contours to locate the dot.
I could easily do this by following up on YouTube videos and from online websites.Â 
Next, I drew lines between the dots using the Pillows  **ImageDraw**  module. The provided Pillow documentation helped a lot to figure this out.
Overall, I enjoyed working on this task and didn't face many issues.
